# CS mode
基于mode(物质-联系->new system)
## 1.1 Hardware
Hardware is fundamental, I can't believe anyone who know programming but don't know any hardware. hardware built computer and whole internet world

## 1.2 Programming
Programming is a powerful tool. It can interact hardware and more height system.
cmd, or real language are both programming. And I believe anything you do on computer is about programming. 

## 1.5 Operating systems
operating system is the hardware build first system. the first level built, so software can build on it and create the new level.

## 2.1 Data&Database
it is a derived concepts.as old says:do any thing is need time.we can't save our time,but we can save our data to use in future even one second later.

## 2.2 Computer networking
this is programming friend,it interact everyone. SSH, web&browser are networking.

## 2.5 Distributed Systems
this is second level, we are end fornow.

## 我认为如果你看完上面的课程后，需要一段时间来判断自己，是想将CS作为职业or爱好。
### 如果是爱好：你可以直接去学习Python，and 做一些小题目然后接触一些小项目锻炼自己，it is enough。
### 如果是职业：可以开始学习C，and 同时学习 MIT Missing Semester
